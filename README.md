# Avalanche Subnet ERC20 and Vault Project

This project includes an implementation of an ERC20 token and a Vault contract on the Avalanche Subnet. The ERC20 contract provides a basic template for creating a fungible token, while the Vault contract interacts with ERC20 tokens, providing additional functionalities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) for smart contract compilation and deployment
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for a personal Ethereum blockchain

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Compile the smart contracts:

```sh
truffle compile
```

or if you are using Hardhat:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Deploy the contracts to your local blockchain (Ganache):

```sh
truffle migrate
```

or with Hardhat:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## ERC20 Contract

The [`ERC20.sol`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FERC20.sol%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\kumar\Contacts\Desktop\Avalanche-Subnet\ERC20.sol") contract is a standard implementation of an ERC20 token. It includes basic functionalities such as transfer, approve, and allowance mechanisms. Additionally, it provides mint and burn functions for token supply management.

- **Contract Name:** Solidity by Example
- **Symbol:** SOLBYEX
- **Decimals:** 18

## Vault Contract

The [`Vault.sol`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FVault.sol%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\kumar\Contacts\Desktop\Avalanche-Subnet\Vault.sol") contract is designed to interact with ERC20 tokens. It provides a template for more complex functionalities that can be built on top of the ERC20 standard.

- **Key Functions:**
  - [`totalSupply()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FVault.sol%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "Vault.sol"): View the total supply of the tokens in the vault.
  - [`balanceOf(address account)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FERC20.sol%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A36%7D%5D "ERC20.sol"): View the balance of tokens for a specific account in the vault.
  - [`transfer(address recipient, uint amount)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FERC20.sol%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "ERC20.sol"): Transfer tokens from the vault to a recipient.
  - [`allowance(address owner, address spender)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FERC20.sol%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A56%7D%5D "ERC20.sol"): Check the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender.
  - [`approve(address spender, uint amount)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fkumar%2FContacts%2FDesktop%2FAvalanche-Subnet%2FERC20.sol%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A21%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "ERC20.sol"): Approve a spender to withdraw tokens from the owner's account up to a certain amount.
