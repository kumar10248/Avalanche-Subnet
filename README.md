# Avalanche Subnets 
The Avalanche Subnet allows you to create customized, independent blockchains tailored to specific use cases. These subnets can have their own rules, consensus mechanisms, and virtual machines. They operate separately from the main Avalanche network but can still communicate with it and other subnets. Subnets enhance scalability by reducing congestion on the main network. You can choose between permissioned and permissionless setups for your subnet.

## Description
###Project requirements
- Deploy your EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI
- Add your Subnet to Metamask
- Make sure it is your selected network in Metamask
- Connect Remix to your Metamask
- Use the Injected Provider
- Deploy the smart-contracts
- Test you application!
Using remix to interact with your deployed smart-contracts, deploy tokens, pools, and more.


I successfully created my own Avalanche subnet, named DevashishSubnet, using Ubuntu. After setting it up, I deployed the subnet and obtained the account address along with some tokens.
Next, I added the subnet to Metamask by entering the RPC URL, chain ID, and token name. I imported my funded account into Metamask and ensured it was selected as the active network.
Then, I connected Remix to my Metamask wallet using the Injected Provider. This allowed me to deploy smart contracts directly onto my subnet. I successfully deployed one contract and began testing my application. Using Remix, I interacted with my deployed smart contracts and explored deploying tokens, pools, and other functionalities.

Created  my own subnet .
- Installing the avalanche


- Checking for the version and creating my subnet


- Deploying the subnet


OUTPUT AFTER SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYING OF THE SUBNET




- Complete Wallet Information
  

- Tokens funded showcasing in the DevashishSubnet
  


- Showing the address of the added subnet(DevashishSubnet) for verification
  


### Program on which i have used up own subnet for deploying and performing the transactions

- OUTPUT
  


- Transactions Confirmation from the own subnet
